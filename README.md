# CodeAlpha_BackgroundGenerator_T1
A background generator is a great way to practice CSS skills and familiarize yourself with basic JavaScript concepts. In this project, you will select a basic or a gradient colour and generate it via code. You will then create a webpage that generates random background colours and allows users to customize and copy the generated colour code.
I've created a captivating blog dedicated to Jane Austen, where I implemented an intriguing background generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With each click of the "Magic" button, the background color transforms, breathing new life into the website's visual appeal. This project seamlessly combines technology and literature, offering a delightful experience to visitors exploring Austen's timeless literary world.
