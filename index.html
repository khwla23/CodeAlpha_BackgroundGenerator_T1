          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English
            novelist known primarily for her six novels, which implicitly
            interpret, critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at
            the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the
            dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social
            standing and economic security. Her works are an implicit critique
            of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century
            and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her
            deft use of social commentary, realism and biting irony have earned
            her acclaim among critics and scholars.

          <h2>Honours</h2>
          <p>
            In 2013, Austen's works featured on a series of UK postage stamps
            issued by the Royal Mail to mark the bicentenary of the publication
            of Pride and Prejudice. Austen is on the £10 note issued by the Bank
            of England which was introduced in 2017, replacing Charles Darwin.
            In July 2017, a statue of Jane Austen was erected in Basingstoke,
            Hampshire on the 200th anniversary of her death.
